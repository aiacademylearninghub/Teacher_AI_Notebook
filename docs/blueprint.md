## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep saffron (#FF9933), a warm and inviting hue inspired by Indian culture.
- Background color: Pale cream (#FAF9F6), providing a soft, non-distracting backdrop that ensures comfortable readability.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080), inspired by India's vibrant seas, balances the warmth of saffron with a calming influence. Using this contrast allows certain calls to action to stand out from other elements on the page.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a clear, modern sans-serif, for lesson text and worksheet content.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', an elegant serif with moderate line contrast and fashionable aesthetic.
- Use icons with a hand-drawn style to represent educational tools and actions, adding a personal touch. The icons are for affordances like the language selector, TTS controls, upload buttons, or file selectors.
- Subtle transition effects and loading animations will enhance user experience. For instance, sources or notes might gracefully fade into view, making interactions intuitive.
- Implement a modern, clean layout inspired by Google NotebookLM, focusing on a two-panel design for sources and studio notes.
- Employ creative and advanced CSS animations to enhance UI elements and interactions, providing a visually engaging experience.
