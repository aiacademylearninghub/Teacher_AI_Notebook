# Components Directory (`/components`)

This directory contains all the React components that make up the user interface of the AI Notebook application. Components are organized into subdirectories based on their function and relationship to features.

## Subdirectories:

-   `/chat`: Components related to the main chat interface.
-   `/layout`: High-level layout components like the main header.
-   `/sources`: Components for adding, viewing, and managing data sources (e.g., uploaded documents).
-   `/studio`: Components that form the "Studio" feature, where users can access various generative tools.
-   `/ui`: Low-level, reusable UI components provided by the ShadCN library (e.g., Button, Card, Dialog).
