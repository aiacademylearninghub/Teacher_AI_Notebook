# UI Components (`/components/ui`)

This directory contains the collection of low-level, reusable UI components from the **ShadCN/UI** library. These components are the basic building blocks of the application's interface.

## Purpose:

ShadCN/UI provides a set of beautifully designed and accessible components that you can copy and paste directly into your project. They are built on top of Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS, making them highly customizable.

This directory holds the local copy of these components, such as `Button.tsx`, `Card.tsx`, `Dialog.tsx`, `Input.tsx`, etc. You can modify these files directly to apply project-wide changes to a specific component type.
