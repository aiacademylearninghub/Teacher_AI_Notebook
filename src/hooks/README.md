# Hooks Directory (`/hooks`)

This directory contains custom React hooks used throughout the AI Notebook application. Hooks are reusable functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.

## Hooks:

-   `use-toast.ts`: A custom hook for managing and displaying "toast" notifications. It provides a simple `toast()` function that can be called from any component to show brief, non-intrusive messages to the user (e.g., for success or error feedback). It is inspired by the `react-hot-toast` library.
