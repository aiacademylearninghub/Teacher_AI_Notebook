### End-to-End Workflow

1. **User Interaction**
   - User accesses the application through the browser
   - Next.js App Router (`/src/app`) handles routing and page rendering
   - Components from `/src/components` build the interface

2. **Frontend Processing**
   - UI components use hooks from `/src/hooks` for state management
   - Components import and use UI library elements from `/src/components/ui`
   - Studio tools (`/src/components/studio/tools`) provide educational features

3. **AI Integration**
   - User requests for AI features are processed through the Genkit framework
   - AI flows in `/src/ai/flows` define the behavior of different AI tools
   - The Student Analyzer and other educational tools use these flows

4. **Data Processing**
   - Server actions in `/src/lib` handle data processing and API calls
   - Utility functions provide shared functionality across components
   - PDF processing uses dedicated utilities in `/src/lib/pdf.ts`

5. **Response Handling**
   - AI-generated results are returned to the frontend
   - Charts and visualizations display student performance data
   - UI updates to show recommendations and insights
